#Parallelized n Body Problem
* Simulated an n-bodies in space environment by finding the updated positions and velocities of the bodies when acted upon by the force of gravity.
* Implemented the shared and distributed memory executions of the Barnes Hut and brute force alogorithms.
* Obtained a radical decrease in time taken when compared to their sequential counterparts.
* Tech Stack - C++, OpenMP, MPI
