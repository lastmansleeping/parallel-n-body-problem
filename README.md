#Parallelized n Body Problem
* Finding the updated positions and velocities of n bodies in space due to the effect of gravity.
* Shared and distributed memory parallel implementations of the Barnes Hut and brute force algorithms were implemented and proven to be faster when compared to their sequential counterparts.
* Tech Stack - C++, OpenMP, MPI
